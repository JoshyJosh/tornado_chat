# WIP

Tornado chat app based on tornado framework demos. The goal is to have a persistent chat log.
Currently working on docker-compose websocket version. Features persistent postgres docker image.

## Dev environment setup
- docker-compose up -d db so you have postgres running, create Pipfile or virtualenv from requirements.txt.
- run either ajax version on appajax folder or websocket version on appsocket by running python chatapp.
